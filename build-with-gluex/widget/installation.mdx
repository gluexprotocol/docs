## Quickstart

Before you start with integration, you'll need to obtain your API Key and Integrator ID. These are essential for authenticating your application and tracking its usage with GlueX.
You can easily generate these credentials by logging into the [GlueX Portal](https://portal.gluex.xyz).

Once you have your credentials, you can integrate the GlueX Widget with just a few lines of code:

```typescript
import { GlueXWidget, WidgetConfiguration } from "@gluex/widget"

const config: Partial<WidgetConfiguration> = {
  apiKey: enviroment.GLUEX_API_KEY,
  integrator: enviroment.INTEGRATOR_ID,
};

export const WidgetPage = () => {
  return <GlueXWidget config={config} />;
};
```
