## About GlueX

GlueX is the execution and data layer of decentralized finance (DeFi) providing a unified suite of onchain and offchain services designed to simplify the complexities of DeFi. Our modular framework abstracts away the complexities by standardizing integrations across diverse blockchains, exchange venues and liquidity providers within a unified framework to simplify, optimize and expedite the access to DeFi. This architecture enables the creation of truly composable applications without requiring developers to build and maintain complex manual integrations across multiple protocols
