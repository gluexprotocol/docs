## Router

The Route API is a powerful and flexible automated pathfinding engine designed for developers to implement efficient onchain interaction logic and calculate optimal path between any two DeFi positions. Whether you’re swapping tokens, entering positions, adding liquidity or moving assets, the API provides everything needed for handling the complex routing logic automatically

### Getting Your First Router Quote

The first step in using the GlueX Router API is to generate a quote for a desired DeFi operation. This can be achieved by sending a POST request to the `/v1/quote` endpoint. It's recommended to start with the below example request and then explore more customization options in the [Router API Reference](/api-reference/router-api/post-quote)

### Sample Request

The first step in using the GlueX Router API to generate a quote. This can be achieved by sending a `POST` request to the `/v1/quote` endpoint. It is recommended to start with the below example request and apply more customization from (here)[/docs/router/quote]

<RouterRequest />

### Sample Response

<RouterResponse />

### How to Use

Once you have the `/quote` response, you can use **any web3 library** (eg: ethers.js, web3.js, web3.py) to build, sign and send the transaction. The key fields you’ll need are:

- **`calldata`**: ABI encoded function call for the router
- **`value`**: Native token amount to attach (if input is a native token)
- **`computationUnits`**: Simulated gas estimate (recommended - `gasLimit = computationUnits × 1.3`)

Simply construct your transaction object with those fields, sign it with your EOA’s private key and broadcast it

### Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Token Swap">
    With **Router’s token swap API**, you can swap **any token A → token B** on any supported blockchain in just **one call**. 
    Instead of dealing with multiple steps like approvals, liquidity sourcing and slippage calculations, 
    Router takes care of everything under the hood, letting you focus on what matters - receiving your desired token directly in your wallet

    ## Why use GlueX for token swaps?

    Traditionally, swapping tokens on a blockchain involves:

    1. **Finding liquidity pools** across decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
    2. **Checking prices and slippage tolerance** to avoid bad execution
    3. **Manually approving tokens** so they can be spent by a smart contract
    4. **Building and broadcasting the transaction** with correct gas settings
    5. **Tracking the transaction** until it confirms

    Router simplifies all of this into a single, streamlined API call. When you specify:

    - The **input token** (what you’re swapping from)
    - The **output token** (what you’re receiving)
    - The **amount**
    - Your **wallet address**

    Router will:

    - **Aggregate liquidity across multiple sources** to find the best route
    - **Handle token approvals automatically**
    - **Execute the transaction in one step**
    - **Send the output tokens directly** to your wallet (or any another specified address)

    This guarantees a **faster**, **more efficient** and **user friendly** swap experience

    ---

    ## Example: Swap **USDT → WBTC** on Ethereum

    Here’s how you can swap **100 USDT** into **WBTC** on Ethereum in a single API request:

    ```json
    POST /v1/quote
    {
      "inputToken": "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",     // USDT contract address
      "outputToken": "0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599",    // WBTC contract address
      "inputAmount": "100000000",                                     // 100 USDT (6 decimals)
      "userAddress": "0xb06B08B7bDb9C21c3a95F6688994172C25A54d91",    // Wallet executing the swap
      "outputReceiver": "0xb06B08B7bDb9C21c3a95F6688994172C25A54d91", // Wallet receiving WBTC
      "chainID": "ethereum",                                          // Target blockchain
      "uniquePID": "<your-unique-pid>"                                // Integrator ID
    }
    ```

    Here’s a real USDT → WBTC one call swap - [0x91c969f626d80c273008627d1a9d47b5f4600d9584ee045f0fdd57a080320dce](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x91c969f626d80c273008627d1a9d47b5f4600d9584ee045f0fdd57a080320dce)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vault Entry">
    With **Router’s vault entry flow**, you can deposit into yield vaults (like Yearn, Aave, etc.) in **just one transaction**
    No matter if you already hold the vault’s underlying asset or need to swap into it first,
    Router handles all the required steps automatically, saving you from manual approvals and multiple transactions

    ## Why use GlueX for vault deposits?

    Normally, entering a vault requires several steps:

    1. **Acquire the correct deposit token** (swap into the asset the vault accepts)
    2. **Approve the vault contract** to spend your tokens
    3. **Deposit the tokens** into the vault
    4. **Wait for confirmation** before receiving vault shares in your wallet

    Router simplifies this process into **a single API call**. You just specify:

    - The **input token** (what you’re starting with)
    - The **vault token** (the token you’ll receive, eg: yvUSDC)
    - The **amount**
    - Your **wallet address**

    Router will:

    - **Swap into the correct deposit asset** if needed
    - **Approve the vault contract automatically**
    - **Deposit the tokens on your behalf**
    - **Send the vault shares (yvTokens) directly** to your wallet (or any another specified address)

    This makes vault entry **seamless**, **gas efficient** and **user friendly**

    ---

    ## Example: Example: Deposit **WBTC → MEVCapital USDC Vault**

    Here’s how you can deposit **WBTC** directly into the **MEVCapital USDC Vault** in one step:

    ```json
    POST /v1/quote
    {
      "inputToken": "0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599",     // WBTC contract address
      "outputToken": "0xd63070114470f685b75b74d60eec7c1113d33a3d",    // MEVCapital USDC Vault token address
      "inputAmount": "50000",                                         // Amount of WBTC in satoshis (5 decimals)
      "userAddress": "0xb06B08B7bDb9C21c3a95F6688994172C25A54d91",    // Wallet executing the deposit
      "outputReceiver": "0xb06B08B7bDb9C21c3a95F6688994172C25A54d91", // Wallet receiving yvUSDC
      "chainID": "ethereum",                                          // Target blockchain
      "uniquePID": "<your-unique-pid>"                                // Integrator ID
    }
    ```

    Here’s a real WBTC → MEVCapital USDC vault deposit transaction - [0xe608be4745380168d4b882f012cb37b0282ff0ff96749ad579747143a4693c6b](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe608be4745380168d4b882f012cb37b0282ff0ff96749ad579747143a4693c6b)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lending">
    With **Router’s lending flow**, you can supply assets to lending protocols (like Aave, Compound, etc) and 
    receive interest-bearing tokens (aTokens, cTokens, etc) in **one unified action**. 
    Whether you already hold the protocol’s required asset or need to swap into it first, Router automates the entire process

    ## Why use GlueX for Lending?

    Normally, lending assets requires several manual steps:

    1. **Swap into the correct deposit token** (eg: swap USDC into WETH if the protocol requires WETH)
    2. **Approve the lending protocol contract** to spend your tokens
    3. **Call the protocol’s deposit method** to supply liquidity
    4. **Receive the corresponding aToken/cToken** representing your deposit

    Router compresses this into **a single call**. You only need to specify:

    - The **input token** (what you’re starting with)
    - The **deposit token** you want to receive (eg: aWETH)
    - The **amount**
    - Your **wallet address**

    Router will:

    - **Swap into the correct asset if needed**
    - **Handle approvals automatically**
    - **Supply liquidity to the protocol**
    - **Deliver the interest bearing token directly** to your wallet (or any another specified address)

    ---

    ## Example: Lend **USDC → Receive aWETH**

    Here’s how to lend **50 USDC** and receive **aWETH** in a single API request:

    ```json
      POST /v1/quote
      {
        "inputToken": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",     // USDC contract address
        "outputToken": "0x4d5f47fa6a74757f35c14fd3a6ef8e3c9bc514e8",    // aWETH contract address (Aave)
        "inputAmount": "50000000",                                      // 50 USDC (6 decimals)
        "userAddress": "0xb06B08B7bDb9C21c3a95F6688994172C25A54d91",    // Wallet executing the deposit
        "outputReceiver": "0xb06B08B7bDb9C21c3a95F6688994172C25A54d91", // Wallet receiving yvUSDC
        "chainID": "ethereum",                                          // Target blockchain
        "uniquePID": "<your-unique-pid>"                                // Integrator ID
      }
    ```

    Here’s a real USDC → Receive aWETH lending transaction - [0x37cdcdf63b962f3a945c37436da2965c12f590cc340eee72dde1187aa9ae0a40](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x37cdcdf63b962f3a945c37436da2965c12f590cc340eee72dde1187aa9ae0a40)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Staking">
    With **Router’s staking flow**, you can stake any token into a staking protocol (such as Lido, Swell, Rocket Pool, etc) 
    and receive the staked token in **a single call**. Whether you already hold the staking asset or need to swap into it first, 
    Router automates the full lifecycle - from swap, to staking - in one gas optimized transaction

    ---

    ## Why Use Router for Staking?  

    Normally, staking involves multiple steps:  

    1. **Swap into the staking asset** if you don’t already hold it
    2. **Approve the staking contract** to spend your tokens
    3. **Send the stake transaction** to the protocol
    4. **Receive your staked token** in return

    Router combines these steps into **one unified API call**. You just specify:  

    - The **input token** (what you’re staking with)
    - The **staked token** you want to receive
    - The **amount**
    - Your **wallet address**

    Router will:  

    - **Swap if required** into the correct staking asset
    - **Approve the staking contract**
    - **Stake on your behalf**
    - **Deliver the staked token directly** to your wallet

    ---
    ## Example: Stake **DAI → swETH**  

    Here’s how to stake **DAI** → **swETH** in one call using Router:  

    ```json
      POST /v1/quote
      {
        "inputToken": "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f",                      // DAI contract address
        "outputToken": "0xf951e335afb289353dc249e82926178eac7ded78",                     // swETH contract address
        "inputAmount": "506591370407006083313",                                           // Amount of DAI (18 decimals)
        "userAddress": "0xb06B08B7bDb9C21c3a95F6688994172C25A54d91",                                       // Wallet executing the stake
        "outputReceiver": "0xb06B08B7bDb9C21c3a95F6688994172C25A54d91                   "                  , // Wallet receiving swETH
        "chainID": "ethereum",                                                          // Target blockchain
        "uniquePID": "866a61811189692e8eccae5d2759724a812fa6f8703ebffe90c29dc1f886bbc1" // Unique request ID
      }
    ```

    Here’s a real USDC → Receive DAI** into **swETH** lending transaction - [0x37cdcdf63b962f3a945c37436da2965c12f590cc340eee72dde1187aa9ae0a40](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x37cdcdf63b962f3a945c37436da2965c12f590cc340eee72dde1187aa9ae0a40)

## Exchange Rate

The Exchange Rates API provides an easy to use, scalable solution for retrieving on-chain exchange rates between any two token pairs across multiple supported blockchains. Whether you’re building a DeFi app, wallet or trading platform, you can fetch realtime, accurate rates in a single batch call

### Sample Request

The first step in using the GlueX Exchange Rates API to fetch the price of a token pair. This can be achieved by sending a `POST` request to the root `/` endpoint. It is recommended to start with the below example request and apply more customization from (here)[/api-reference/exchange-rate-api/post-price]

<Note>Each call can batch upto 25 pairs per request</Note>

<ExchangeRateRequest />

### Sample Request

<ExchangeRateResponse />

### How to Use

- Parse the JSON: Iterate over the array to extract price for each token pair
- Batching: Request up to 25 pairs at once to minimize round trips
- No Auth Needed: Public access by default, supply an API key header for higher rate limits when available
